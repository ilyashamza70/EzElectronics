Estimation Approach ![](Aspose.Words.0390d381-466e-490b-97f3-38f0a5979970.004.png)

Consider the EzElectronics project in CURRENT version (as given by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course, and from scratch.

1. Estimate by size ![](Aspose.Words.0390d381-466e-490b-97f3-38f0a5979970.005.png)



||Estimate|
| :- | - |
|NC = Estimated number of classes to be developed|24|
|A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC|83|
|S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC \* A)|1992|
|E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)|200|
|C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)|6000|
|Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week)|9 days|

2. Estimate by product decomposition ![](Aspose.Words.0390d381-466e-490b-97f3-38f0a5979970.006.png)

Summary ![](Aspose.Words.0390d381-466e-490b-97f3-38f0a5979970.016.png)

Here we report the results of the three estimation approaches. The estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference



||Estimated effort|Estimated duration|
| :- | - | - |
|estimate by size|200|9 days |
|estimate by product decomposition|350|87\.5 hours (15 days)|
|estimate by activity decomposition|371|16 days|

The difference between the 3 estimations, is because of the different approaches.

In the first approach, we don't think about the details, we only calculate the effort and the duration needed from the lines of code estimated to be written. while in the second approach we compute the duration by decomposing the product, finally in the 3rd approach we estimated the effort and the duration by estimating the time needed to finish each activity.
